### Website Performance Optimization Portfolio

There are src and dist folders containing source and production code. The dist folder can be found at the gh-pages version of the repository, [here](http://marydurkin.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/)

(If you would like to rebuild the dist files, download the repository and fun the grunt command in the terminal).

For part one of the project the index.html page gets pagespeed scores of: 95-speed 100-UExp (mobile) and 97 (desktop)

For part two: the 'average time to generate last 10 frames' when scrolling is between 0.3 and 0.47ms, with no forced reflow visible in the devtools timeline.

The 'Time to resize pizzas:' measurement comes between 1.16 and 2.33ms

##Thank You!
